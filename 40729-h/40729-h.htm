<div class='hang1'>SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Christmas Eve. Counting house of Scrooge
&amp; Marley. Set fireplace with small grate fire</i> <span class='small'>L.</span>
<i>Centre door in flat, thrown open, showing a small
inner chamber and desk, at which Bob Cratchit is

over the candle. Small desk,</i> <span class='small'>L. C.</span>, <i>at which Scrooge
is discovered busy at figures</i>.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='center'><i>Enter Bob Cratchit, from inner room, with coal shovel,
going toward fireplace.</i></div>

<p><i>Scrooge.</i> And six makes twenty-eight pounds, four
shill&mdash;&mdash;What do you want in here?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> My fire is nearly out, sir, and I thought I would
take one or two lumps of coal, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> You think more of your personal comforts than
you do of your business and my interest.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> The room, sir, is very cold, and I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Work sir, work! and I'll warrant that you'll
keep warm. If you persist, in this wanton waste of coals,
you and I will have to part. (<i>Bob retires to his desk,
puts on his white comforter, and again tries to warm his
hands. Scrooge resuming</i>). Four shillings and ninepence&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Enter Fred'k Merry</i>, <span class='small'>C. D.</span>, <i>saluting Bob as he passes him</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> A Merry Christmas, uncle. God save you.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Bah; humbug.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Christmas a humbug, uncle! You don't mean
that, I'm sure?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> I do. Merry Christmas! What right have you
to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You're
poor enough.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Come then. What right have you to be dismal?
What reason have you to be morose? You're rich
enough.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Bah; humbug.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Don't be cross, uncle.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> What else can I be when I live in such a world
of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon Merry
Christmas! What's Christmas-time to you but a time for
paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a
year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing
your books and having every item in 'em through a round
dozen of months presented dead against you? If I could
work my will, every idiot who goes about with "Merry
Christmas" on his lips should be boiled with his own
pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his
heart. He should.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Uncle!</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> (<i>sternly</i>). Nephew, keep Christmas in your own
way, and let me keep it in mine.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Keep it! But you don't keep it.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Let me leave it alone, then. Much good may
it do you. Much good it has ever done you.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> There are many things from which I might
have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare
say, Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have
always thought of Christmas-time, when it came round&mdash;apart
from the veneration due to its sacred name and
origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that&mdash;as
a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant
time; the only time I know of, in the long <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'calender'">calendar</ins> of the
year, when men and women seem by one consent to open
their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below
them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the
grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other
journeys. And, therefore, uncle, though it has never put
a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it
<i>has</i> done me good, and <i>will</i> do me good; and I say, God
bless it. (<i>Cratchit applauds, but observing Scrooge,

<p><i>Scro.</i> (<i>to Bob</i>). Let me hear another sound from <i>you</i>,
and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation!
(<i>To Fred</i>). You're quite a powerful speaker, sir, I wonder
you don't go into Parliament.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Don't be angry, uncle. Come, dine with us to-morrow?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> I'd see you in blazes first.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> But why? Why?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Why did you get married?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Because I fell in love.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Because you fell in love! The only one thing
in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas.
Good afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before
that happened. Why give it as a reason for not
coming now?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Good afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of
you; why cannot we be friends?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Good afternoon!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so
resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I
have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage
to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humor to the
last. So a Merry Christmas, uncle.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Good afternoon!</p>

<div class='center'>(<i>As Fred goes out he exchanges greetings with Bob.</i>)</div>

<p><i>Fred.</i> A merry Christmas.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> The same to you, and many of them.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> There's another fellow, my clerk, with fifteen
shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a
Merry Christmas. I'll retire to the lunatic asylum.</p>

<div class='center'><i>Enter Mr. Mumford and Mr. Barnes with subscription
book and paper, ushered in by Bob.</i></div>

<p><i>Mr. Mumford.</i> Scrooge &amp; Marley's. I believe (<i>referring
to paper</i>). Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr.
Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Mr. Marley his been dead these seven years.
He died seven years ago this very night.</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> We have no doubt his liberality is well represented
by his surviving partner. (<i>Presents list.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Scrooge frowns, shakes his head, and returns it.</i>) At
this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge, it is more
than usually desirable that we should make some slight
provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly
at the present time. Many thousands are in want of
common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want
of common comforts, sir.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Are there no prisons?</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> Plenty of prisons.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> And the union work-houses&mdash;are they still in
operation?</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> They are. I wish I could say they were not.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> The tread-mill and the poor law are in full
vigor, then?</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> Both very busy, sir.</p>

<p><i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Sch'">Scro</ins></i>. Oh! I was afraid from what you said at first
that something had occurred to stop them in their useful
course. I'm very glad to hear it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> Under the impression that they scarcely furnish
Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude, a
few of us are endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the poor
some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We chose
this time because it is a time, of all others, when want is
keenly felt, and abundance rejoices. What shall I put
you down for?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Nothing.</p>

<p><i>Mr. M.</i> You wish to be anonymous?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> I wish to be left alone. Since you ask me what
I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make
merry myself at Christmas, and I can't afford to make
idle people merry. I help to support the establishments
I have mentioned; they cost enough, and those who are
badly off must go there.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> Many can't go there; and many would rather
die.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> If they had rather die, they had better do it,
and decrease the surplus population. Besides, excuse
me, I don't know that.</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> But you might know it.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> It's not my business. It's enough for a man to
understand his own business, and not interfere with other
people's. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon,
gentlemen.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

Begone! I'll have none of your carols here. (<i>Makes

<p><i>Bob.</i> If quite convenient, sir.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> It's not convenient, and its not fair. If I was
to stop half-a-crown for it you'd think yourself ill-used,
I'll be bound? (<i>Bob smiles faintly.</i>) And yet you
don't think <i>me</i> ill-used when I pay a day's wages for no

<p><i>Bob.</i> It's only once a year, sir.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every

<p><i>Bob.</i> I will, sir. You old skinflint. If I had my

Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in

<p><i>Scro.</i> It's humbug still! I won't believe it. [<i>Pause,

<p><i>Ghost.</i> Much.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Who are you?</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> Ask me who I <i>was</i>.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Who <i>were</i> you then? You're particular, for a
shade.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Can you&mdash;can you sit down?</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> I can.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Do it, then.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> You don't believe in me?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> I don't.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> What evidence do you require of my reality beyond
that of your senses?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> I don't know.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> Why do you doubt your senses?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Because a little thing affects them. A slight
disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may
be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb
of cheese, a fragment of an under-done potato. There's
more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are.
You see this tooth-pick?</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> I do.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> You are not looking at it.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> But I see it, notwithstanding.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Well! I have but to swallow this, and be for
the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of gobblins, all
of my own creation. Humbug, I tell you; humbug.
(<i>Ghost rattles chain, takes bandage off jaws, and drops
lower jaw as far as possible.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> (<i>Betrays signs of fright.</i>) Mercy! dreadful
apparition, why do you trouble me?</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> Man of the worldly mind, do you believe in me,
or not?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> I do. I must. But why do spirits walk the
earth, and why do they come to me?</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> It is required of every man that the spirit within
him should walk abroad among his fellow men and
travel far and wide, and if that spirit goes not forth in
life, it is condemned to do so after death. It is doomed
to wander through the world&mdash;oh, woe is me&mdash;and witness
what it can not share, but might have shared on
earth, turned to happiness. [<i>Shakes chain and wrings
his hands.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> You are fettered; tell me why?</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> I wear the chain I forged in life; I <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'make'">made</ins> it link
by link and yard by yard. I girded it on of my own free
will, and of my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern
strange to <i>you</i>? Or would you know the weight and
length of the strong coil you bear yourself. It was full
as heavy and as long as this seven Christmas-eves ago.
You have labored on it since. It is a pondrous chain!</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Jacob, old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak
comfort to me, Jacob.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> I have none to give. It comes from other regions,
Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers
to other lands of men. Nor can I tell you what I
would. A very little more is all that is permitted to me.
I can not rest, I can not stay, I can not linger anywhere.
My spirit never walked beyond our counting house,
mark me!&mdash;in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow
limits of our money changing hole; and weary journeys
lie before me.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> You must have been very slow about it, Jacob.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> Slow?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Seven years dead. And traveling all the time.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> The old time. No rest, no peace. Incessant
tortures of remorse.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> You travel fast?</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> On the wings of the wind.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> You might have got over a great quantity of
ground in seven years, Jacob.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> (<i>Clinking his chain.</i>) Oh! captive, bound and
double-ironed, not to know that ages of incessant labor
by immortal creatures; for this earth must pass into eternity
before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed.
Not to know that any Christian spirit working
kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness.
Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for
one life's opportunity misused. Yet, such was I. Oh,
such was I!</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> But you were always a good man of business
Jacob.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> Business! [<i>wringing his hands and shaking
chain.</i>] Mankind was my business. The common welfare
was my business. Charity, mercy, forbearance and
benevolence were all my business. The dealings of my
trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive
ocean of my business. [<i>Holds up chain at arm's length,
and drops it.</i>] At this time of the rolling year I suffer
most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow beings
with my eyes turned down, and never raise them, to that
blessed Star which led the wise men to a poor abode?
Were there no poor houses to which its light would have
conducted <i>me</i>? Hear me! my time is nearly gone.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> I will; but don't be hard upon me. Don't be
flowery, Jacob, pray.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> How it is that I appear before you in a shape
that you can see, I may not tell. I have sat <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'invisable'">invisible</ins> beside
you many and many a day. That is no light part of
my penance. I am here to-night to warn you that you
have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A
chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> You were always a good friend to me. Thank 'er.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> You will be haunted by three spirits.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Is that the chance and hope you mentioned,
Jacob?</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> It is.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> I&mdash;I think I'd rather not.</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> Without their visits you can not hope to shun
the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow, when the
bell tolls one.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Couldn't I take'em all at once, and have it over,
Jacob?</p>

<p><i>Gho.</i> Expect the second on the next night at the
same hour. The third on the night following, when
the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look
to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you
remember what has passed between us. [<i>Ghost replaces

<p><i>Spir.</i> You remember it?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Yes, yes; I know! I was reading all about
Ali Baba. Dear old honest Ali Baba. And Valentine and
his wild brother, Orson; and the Sultan's groom turned
upside down by the Geni. Served him right, I'm glad of

<p><i>Spir.</i> A small matter to make these silly folks so full

<p><i>Scro.</i> Small! Why, old Fezziwig was one of the best
men that ever lived. He never missed giving his employees
a Christmas ball.</p>

<p><i>Spir.</i> Why, is it not! He spent but a few pounds of
money&mdash;three or four pounds, perhaps&mdash;. Is that so
much that he deserves your praise?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> It isn't that, Spirit. He had the power to render
us happy or unhappy; to make our services light or
burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power
lives in words and looks; in things so light and unsignificant
that it is impossible to add and count 'em up;
what then? The happiness he gives is quite as great
if it cost a fortune&mdash;oh, dear.</p>

<p><i>Spir.</i> What is the matter?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Nothing, particular.</p>

<p><i>Spir.</i> Something, I think.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> No, no. I should like to be able to say a word

<p><i>Belle.</i> It matters little to you. To you very little.
Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and
comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do,
I have no just cause to grieve.</p>

<p><i>Young S.</i> What idol has displaced you?</p>

<p><i>Belle.</i> A golden one.</p>

<p><i>Young S.</i> This is the even-handed dealing of the
world. There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty;
and there is nothing it professes to condemn with
such severity, as the pursuit of wealth.</p>

<p><i>Belle.</i> You fear the world <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'to'">too</ins> much. All your other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the
chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler
aspirations fall off one by one, until the master passion
<i>gain</i>, engrosses you. Have I not?</p>

<p><i>Young S.</i> What then? Even if I have grown so
much wiser, what then? I am not changed toward you,
(<i>She shakes her head.</i>) Am I?</p>

<p><i>Belle.</i> Our contract is an old one. It was made when
we were both poor and content to be so, until in good
season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient
industry. You <i>are</i> changed. When it was made
you were another man.</p>

<p><i>Young S.</i> I was a boy.</p>

<p><i>Belle.</i> Your own feeling tells you that you were not
what you are. I am. That which promised happiness
when we were one in heart is fraught with misery now
that we are two. How often and how keenly I have
thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I <i>have</i>
thought of it, and can release you.</p>

<p><i>Young S.</i> Have I ever sought release?</p>

<p><i>Belle.</i> In words; no, never.</p>

<p><i>Young S.</i> In what, then?</p>

<p><i>Belle.</i> In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in
another atmosphere of life; another hope as to its great
end. In everything that made my love of any worth or
value in your sight. If this had never been between us,
tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now?
Ah, no!</p>

<p><i>Young S.</i> You think not?</p>

<p><i>Belle.</i> I would gladly think otherwise, if I could;
Heaven knows. When I have learned a truth like this,
I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you
were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe
that you would choose a dowerless girl&mdash;you, who, in
your very confidence with her, weigh everything by gain;
or <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'chosing'">choosing</ins> her, if for a moment you were false enough
to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know
that your repentance and regret would surely follow? I
do; and I release you, with a full heart, for the love
of him you once were. (<i>He is about to speak, but with
her head turned from him she resumes.</i>) You may&mdash;the
memory of what is past half makes me hope you will&mdash;have
pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will
dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an unprofitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Spirit, show me no more! Conduct me home.
Why do you delight to torture me?</p>

<p><i>Spir.</i> O, mortal, what a treasure didst thou cast
away. She, whom you resigned for paltry gold, became
the happy wife of your former schoolmate, Kemper.
One shadow more. Behold now the tender mother of

<p><i>Mr. K.</i> Belle, I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. K.</i> Who was it?</p>

<p><i>Mr. K.</i> Guess?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. K.</i> How can I? Tut, don't I know (<i>laughingly</i>),
Mr. Scrooge?</p>

<p><i>Mr. K.</i> Mr. Scrooge it was&mdash;your old sweetheart (<i>laughing</i>).
I passed his office window, and as it was not shut up,
and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing
him. His partner, old Jacob Marley, lies upon the
point of death, I hear. And there he sat, alone. Quite
alone in the world, I do believe.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. K.</i> Poor old man.</p>

<div class='center'>[<i>Scene Closes.</i>]</div>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Spirit (<i>in a broken voice</i>), remove me from

<p><i>Spir.</i> I told you these were shadows of the things that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
have been. That they are what they are, do not blame
me.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> I am to blame for what they are, and now that
I see what they might have been, I am more wretched
than ever. Remove me! I can not bear it. (<i>Turns
upon the spirit, and struggles with it.</i>) Leave me! Take
me back! Haunt me no longer! (<i>Seizes the extinguisher-cap,

Have you had many brothers, Spirit?</p>

<p><i>Spir.</i> More than eighteen hundred.</p>

conduct me where you will. I went forth last night on

<p><i>Mar.</i> (<i>Running into his arms.</i>) Dear father! I could

<p><i>Bob.</i> (<i>Embraces her.</i>) You're a good girl, Martha,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and a great comfort to us all. (<i>Commences to mix a
bowl of punch.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> And how did little Tim behave?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> As good as gold, and better. Somehow he gets
thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the
strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming
home, that he hoped the people saw him in church, because
he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them
to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars

<p><i>Tiny T.</i> God bless us every one.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live?</p>

<p><i>Spir.</i> I see a vacant seat in the poor chimney-corner
and a crutch without an owner carefully preserved.
If these shadows remain unaltered by the future, none
other of my race will find him here. What then? If he
be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus
population.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> (<i>Hangs his head.</i>) My very words.</p>

<p><i>Spir.</i> Man&mdash;if man you be in heart, not adamant&mdash;forbear
that wicked cant until you have discovered what
the surplus is, and where it is. Will you decide what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
men shall live, what men shall die. It may be, in the
sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live
than millions like this poor man's child. Oh, Heaven! to
hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much
life among his hungry brothers of the dust!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Now, Martha and Belinda, change the plates,

Here is what will remind us it is Christmas. (<i>Fills three
tumblers and custard-cup without a handle, and passes
them to Mrs. C., Peter and Martha.</i>) I'll give you Mr.
Scrooge, the founder of the feast.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> The founder of the feast, indeed! I wish I
had him here, I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast
upon, and I hope he'd have a good appetite for it.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> My dear, the children! Christmas Day.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> It should be Christmas Day, I am sure, on
which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy,
hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is,
Robert. Nobody knows it better than you, poor fellow.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> My dear. Christmas Day.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> I'll drink his health for your sake and the
day's, not for his. Long life to him. A Merry Christmas

very happy, I have no doubt.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> A Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Spirit, take me away. I see the very mention
of my name casts a gloom on what, were it not for me,
would be a very happy party.</p>

<p><i>Spir.</i> Wait; they will soon put the memory of you
aside, and will be ten times merrier than before, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ahd'">and</ins> Tiny
Tim will sing.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> No, no; take me hence.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> He believed it, too.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> More shame for him, Fred!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> He's a comical old fellow, that's the truth; and
not so pleasant as he might be; however, his offenses
carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say
against him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I'm sure he's very rich, Fred. At least you
always tell <i>me</i> so.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> What of that, my dear. His wealth is of no use
to him. He don't do any good with it. He don't make
himself comfortable with it. He hasn't the satisfaction of
thinking&mdash;ha, ha, ha, ha!&mdash;that he is ever going to benefit

<p><i>Julia.</i> Neither have I for such a stingy old wretch!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Oh, I have. I am sorry for him; I couldn't be
angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims?
Himself, always. Here he takes it into his head to dislike
us, and he won't come and dine with us. What's the
consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner.</p>

<p><i>Sarah.</i> A much better one than he could have served

<p><i>Fred.</i> Well, I'm very glad to hear it, because I haven't
great faith in these young <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'househeepers'">housekeepers</ins>. What do <i>you</i>

<p><i>Topper.</i> A bachelor like myself is a wretched outcast,
and has no right to express an opinion on such an important
subject.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Do go on, Fred. He never finishes what he
begins to say. He is such a ridiculous fellow.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I was only going to say, that the consequence
of our uncle taking a dislike to us, and not making merry
with us, <i>is</i>, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments,
which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses
pleasanter companions than he finds in his own thoughts,
either in his moldy old office or his dusty chambers. I
mean to give him the same chance every year, whether
he likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas
till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it&mdash;I
defy him&mdash;if he finds me going there, in good temper,
year after year, and saying, Uncle Scrooge, I wish
you A Merry Christmas and A Happy New Year! If
it only puts him in the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'vain'">vein</ins> to leave his poor clerk
fifty pounds, <i>that's</i> something; and I think I shook him
yesterday.&mdash;Come, let us have some music. Here, Thomas,

<p><i>All.</i> Agreed.</p>

<p><i>Spir.</i> Time flies; I have grown old. We must hasten

<p><i>Scro.</i> No, no! One half hour, Spirit, only one.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> I have a new game to propose.</p>

<p><i>Sarah.</i> What is it?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> It is a game called Yes and No. I am to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of something and you are all to guess what it is. I am
thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable

walks about the streets, and is not made a show of, and is
not led by anybody and don't live in a menagerie, and is
not a horse, a cow or a donkey or a bull. There, now
guess?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Is it a pig?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Is it a bear?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred!
I know what it is!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> What is it?</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> It's your uncle Scro-o-o-oge!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Ha, ha, ha! ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> It is hardly fair, you ought to have said yes,
when I said, it's a bear.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> He has given us plenty of merriment, I'm sure,
and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health. Here
is some mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment;
and when you are ready I say uncle Scrooge! (<i>Servant
brings wine forward.</i>)</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Well! Uncle Scrooge!</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> A Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year to
the old man. He wouldn't take it from me, but may he
have it, nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!</p>

with its hand. You are about to show me the shadows
of things that have not happened, but will happen in
the time before us. Is that so, Spirit? (<i>Rises and stands
trembling.</i>) Ghost of the Future, I fear you more than
any spectre I have seen; but as I know your purpose is
to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man
from what I was, I am <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'prepered'">prepared</ins> to bear you company,

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> Why, what was the matter with him? (<i>Takes
snuff out of a large snuff-box.</i>) I thought he would
never die.</p>

<p><i>Mr. F.</i> I did not take the trouble to inquire.</p>

<p><i>Mr. R.</i> What has he done with his money?</p>

<p><i>Mr. F.</i> I haven't heard (<i>yawning</i>); left it to his company,
perhaps. He hasn't left it to <i>me</i>. That's all I know.
(<i>All laugh.</i>) It's likely to be a very cheap funeral, for
upon my life I don't know of any body to go to it. Suppose
we make up a party and volunteer?</p>

<p><i>Mr. R.</i> I don't mind going if a lunch is provided.
I must be fed if I make one. (<i>All laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mr. F.</i> Well, I am the most disinterested, after all,
for I never wear black gloves and I never eat lunch. But
I'll offer to go, if any body else will. When I come to
think of it, I am not at all sure that I wasn't his most
particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever
we met.</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> I would volunteer, but that I have another
little matter to attend to that will prevent me. However,
I have no objections to joining you in a drink to his
memory.</p>

<p><i>Mr. R.</i> I am with you. Let us adjourn to the punch
bowl. [<i>Exeunt.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> To whom can these allusions refer; Jacob Marley
has been dead these seven years, and surely those
whom I have considered my best friends would not speak
of my death so unfeelingly. I suppose, however, that
these conversations have some latent moral for my own
improvement, and as I have now resolved upon a change
of life, I shall treasure up all I see and hear. Lead on,
Shadow, I follow! (<i>Crosses to the opposite entrance and

<div class='center'>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>Interior of a junk or pawn-shop.</i><br /><br />

<i>Enter Old Joe, ushering in Mrs. Mangle, Mrs. Dilber
and Mr. Shroud, door in flat.</i></div>

<p><i>Old Joe.</i> You couldn't have met in a better place;
come in. You were made free here long ago, you know,
and the other two ain't strangers. Stop till I shut the
door of the shop. Ah! how it <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'skrieks'">shrieks</ins>! There isn't
such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I
believe, and I'm sure there's no such old bones here as
mine. Ha, ha! We're all suitable to our calling, we're
well matched. Come, come! we are at home here.
(<i>Trims smoky lamp at table.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> What odds, then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?
(<i>Throws her bundle on the floor and sits on a stool, resting
her elbows on her knees.</i>) Every person has a right
to take care of themselves. <i>He</i> always did.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. D.</i> That's true, indeed! No man cared for himself
more than he did.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Why, then, don't stand staring as if you was
afraid, woman; who's the wiser? We're not going to
pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Shroud.</i> No, indeed! We should hope not.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Very well, then: that's enough. Who's the
worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a
dead man, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> (<i>Laughing.</i>) No, indeed.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead,
the wicked old Screw, why wasn't he natural in his life
time? If he had been, he'd have had somebody to look
after him when he was struck with death, instead of lying
gasping out his last there, alone by himself.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. D.</i> It's the truest word ever was spoke. It's a
judgment on him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I wish it was a little heavier judgment, and
it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could
have laid my hands on anything else. Open that bundle,
Old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out
plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid to let
them see it. We knew pretty well that we were helping
ourselves, before we met here, I believe. It's no sin.
Open the bundle, Joe.</p>

<p><i>Mr. S.</i> Oh, no; we don't mind showing what we have.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Here, Joe, value these. (<i>Mrs. D. and Mr. S. lay their
packages on the table and Joe proceeds to examine them.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Joe.</i> (<i>Chalking the figures on the wall as he names
them.</i>) A seal, eight shillings; pencil-case, three and six
pence; pair of sleeve-buttons, five and four-pence; scarf-pin,
ninepence. Nine and four, thirteen, and six, is nineteen&mdash;seven.
One and five's six, and thirteen is nine, and
eight makes seventeen. That's your account, and I
wouldn't give another sixpence if I was to be boiled for
it. Who's next?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. D.</i> I hope you'll be more liberal with me, Mr.
Joe. I'm a poor, lone widow, and it's hard for me to
make a living.</p>

<p><i>Joe.</i> I always give too much to the ladies. It's a
weakness of mine, and that's the way I ruin <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'mysel'">myself</ins>. Under-clothing,
sheets, towels, sugar-tongs; these tea-spoons
are old-fashioned, and the boots won't bear mending.
One pound six, that's your account. If you asked me
another penny, and made it an open question I'd repent
of being liberal, and knock off half a crown.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Now, undo <i>my</i> bundle, Joe.</p>

<p><i>Joe.</i> (<i>Opening bundle.</i>) What do you call this? Bed
curtains?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Ah! (<i>Laughing.</i>) Bed curtains.</p>

<p><i>Joe.</i> You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings
and all, with Old Scrooge lying there?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Yes I do. Why not?</p>

<p><i>Joe.</i> You were born to make your fortune, and you'll
certainly do it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can
get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such
a man as <i>he</i> was, I promise you, Joe. Don't drop that
oil upon the blanket, now.</p>

<p><i>Joe.</i> His blankets?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Whose else's do you think? He isn't likely
to take cold without 'em, I dare say.</p>

<p>Joe. I hope he didn't die of anything catching. Eh?
(<i>Stopping his work and looking up.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Don't you be afraid of that: I ain't so fond
of his company that I'd loiter about him for such things
if he did. Ah, you may look through that shirt till your
eyes ache, but you won't find a hole in it nor a thread-bare
place. It's the best he had, and a fine one, too.
They'd have wasted it if it hadn't been for me.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Joe.</i> What do you call wasting of it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> (<i>laughing.</i>) Putting it on him to be
buried in, to be sure. Somebody was fool enough to do
it, but I took it off again. If calico ain't good enough
for such a purpose, it isn't good enough for anything.
It's as becoming to the body. He can't look uglier than
he did in that one.</p>

<p><i>Joe.</i> Well, well! I'll ruin myself again. I'll give you
two guineas for the lot, and go to the bankrupt court.
(<i>Takes bag of coin and counts out their amounts.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Ha, ha! This is the end of it, you see. He
frightened every one away from him when he was alive,
to profit us when he was dead.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Ha, ha, ha! [<i>Exeunt door in flat, old Joe lighting
them out.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Spirit! I see, I see. This is my own case, if
nothing happens to change it. My life tends this way.
Spirit, in leaving this. I shall not leave its lesson; trust
me. If there is any person in the city who feels the least
emotion for the death here announced, show that person
to me. [<i>Crosses to</i> <span class='small'>L.</span>, <i>while scene closes in</i>.]<br /><br /></p>


<div class='center'>SCENE IV.&mdash;<i>Street. Exterior of Scrooge &amp; Marley's
Counting House.</i></div>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Why, here is my place of business, and has been
occupied by Scrooge &amp; Marley for many years. I see the
house, let me behold what I shall be in the days to come.
Why, Spirit, the house is yonder. Why do you point
away? (<i>Goes to the window and looks in.</i>) It is the
old office still; the same furniture; but no one occupies
my chair. Ah! some one comes.</p>

<div class='center'><i>Enter James Badger from Counting House, going off
right, meets Mrs. Badger at right entrance.</i></div>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Ah! James. I have waited for you so long.
What news? Is it good or bad?</p>

<p><i>James.</i> Bad.</p>

<p><i>Mrs B.</i> We are quite ruined?</p>

<p><i>James.</i> No. There is hope yet, Caroline.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> If <i>he</i> relents, there is. Nothing is past hope,
if such a miracle has happened.</p>

<p><i>James.</i> He is past relenting. He is dead.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Dead! Thank Heaven; we are saved.
(<i>Pause.</i>) I pray forgiveness, I am sorry that I gave
expression to the emotions of my heart.</p>

<p><i>James.</i> What the half drunken woman, whom I told
you of last night, said to me when I tried to see him and
obtain a week's delay, and what I thought was a mere
excuse to avoid me, turns out to have been quite true.
He was not only very ill, but dying then.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> To whom will our debt be transferred?</p>

<p><i>James.</i> I don't know, and I have been unable to ascertain.
At all events, before that time we shall be ready
with the money; and even though we were not, it would
be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor
in his successor. We may sleep to-night with light
hearts, Caroline!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Yes; and our dear children will be brighter
when they find the gloom dispelled from the minds of
their parents. We cannot deny that this man's death
has occasioned some happiness.</p>

<p><i>James.</i> Come, let us hurry home [<i>Exeunt</i>, <span class='small'>R.</span>]</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Spirit, it is evident that the only emotion you
can show me, caused by the event foreshadowed, is
one of pleasure. Let me see some tenderness connected
with the death of another, or what has just been
shown me will be forever present in my mind.<br /><br /></p>


<div class='hang1'>SCENE V.&mdash;<i>Bob Cratchit's home. Mrs. Cratchit, Belinda,
Little Cratchit and Peter Cratchit discovered
at table, the two former sewing and the latter reading
a book.</i></div>

<p><i>Peter.</i> (<i>Reading.</i>) And he took a child and set him
in the midst of them.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Where have I heard those words? I have not
dreamed them. Why does he not go on?</p>

<p><i>Mrs C.</i> (<i>Betrays emotions; lays her work upon the
table, and puts her hand to her face.</i>) The color hurts
my eyes.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> Yes, poor Tiny Tim!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> They're better now. It makes them weak
by candle-light; and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your
father when he comes home, for the world. It must be
near his time. (<i>Resumes her work.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Past it, rather (<i>shutting up book</i>), but I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
he has walked a little slower than he used, these last few
evenings, mother.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> (<i>In a faltering voice.</i>) I have known him
walk with&mdash;I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon
his shoulder very fast indeed.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> And so have I, often.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> And so have I.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> But he was very light to carry, and his father
loved him so, that it was no trouble; no trouble. And
there is your father at the door.</p>

<div class='center'><i>Enter Bob Cratchit. Belinda and Little Cratchit meet

<p><i>Bob.</i> Hard at work, my dears; hard at work. Why,
how industrious you are, and what progress you are making.
You will be done long before Sunday.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Yes, my dear; I wish you could have gone, it
would have done you good to see how green a place it is.
But you'll see it often. I promised him that I would walk
there on a Sunday. My little, little child! my little
child! (<i>Rises and retires up stage to compose himself;
returns and resumes his place at the table.</i>) Oh, I must
tell you of the extraordinary kindness of Mr Scrooge's
nephew, whom I have scarcely seen but once, and who,
meeting me in the street, and seeing that I looked a little&mdash;just
a little&mdash;down, you know, inquired what had happened
to distress me. On which, for he is the pleasantest-spoken
gentleman you ever heard, I told him. I am
heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit, he said, and heartily
sorry for your good wife. By-the-bye, how he ever knew
<i>that</i>, I don't know.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Knew what, my dear?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Why, that you were a good wife.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Everybody knows that!</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> Very well observed, my boy. I hope they do.
Heartily sorry, he said, for your good wife. If I can be
of service to you in any way, he said, giving me his
card, that's where I live; pray come to me. Now, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
wasn't for the sake of anything he might be able to do
for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite
delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny
Tim, and felt with us.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> I'm sure he's a good soul.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> You would be sure of it, my dear, if you saw
and spoke to him. I shouldn't be at all surprised&mdash;mark
my words&mdash;if he got Peter a better situation.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.</i> Only hear that, Peter.</p>

<p><i>Bel.</i> And then Peter will be keeping company with
some one, and setting up for himself.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> (<i>Grinning</i>.) Get along with you!</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> It's just as likely as not, one of these days;
though there's plenty of time for that, my dear. But,
however and whenever we part from one another, I am
sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim, shall we?</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Never, father.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> And I know, I know, my dears, that when we
recollect how patient and how mild he was&mdash;although he
was a little child&mdash;we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves,
and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.</p>

<p><i>All.</i> No, never, father. (<i>All rise.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> I am very happy. I am very happy! (<i>Kisses

<p><i>Scro.</i> Spirit! Hear me! I am not the man I was.
I will not be the man I must have been, but for this
intercourse. Why have shown me all that you have, if
I am past all hope? Good Spirit, your nature intercedes
for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may change
the shadows you have shown me, by an altered life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Your hand trembles. I will honor Christmas in my
heart and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the
Past, the Present and the Future. The spirits of all
three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons
that they teach. Oh! tell me I may sponge away
the shadows of the future. (<i>Grasps the easy chair in
his agony, as if struggling to detain it.</i>) Do not go, I
entreat you. It shrinks, it has collapsed, it has dwindled
down into an easy chair. Yes! my own chair, my own
room and best&mdash;and happiest of all&mdash;my own time before
me to make amends in. Oh, Jacob Marley, Heaven and
the Christmas time be praised for this! I say it on my

will! (<i>Commences to dress himself, putting everything

giddy as a drunken man. A Merry Christmas to every
body! A Happy New year to all the world! Halloo
here! Waoop! Halloo! (<i>Dancing and capering around
the room.</i>) There's the saucepan that the gruel was in;
there's the door by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered;
there's the corner (<i>pointing into adjoining room</i>)
where the Ghost of Christmas Past sat. It's all right;
it's all true; it all happened. Ha, ha, ha! (<i>Laughing
heartily.</i>) I don't know what day of the month it is. I
don't know how long I've been among the Spirits. I
don't know any thing. I'm quite a baby. Never mind;
I don't care. I'd rather be a baby. Haloo! whoop!
Halloo here! (<i>Bells or chimes commences to ring. Goes

tell 'em to bring it here, that I may give them the directions
where to take it. Come back with the man, and
I'll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less than

off like a shot. I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's. (<i>Rubbing

for a further extension of time.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Why, James, how much do you owe me?</p>

<p><i>James.</i> Twenty pounds, sir.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> How long since you contracted the debt?</p>

<p><i>James.</i> Ten years to morrow, sir.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Then you have already paid me over half the
amount in interest, which interest has been compounded,
and I have, in fact, received more than the principal. My
dear fellow, you owe me nothing, just consider the debt
cancelled.</p>

<p><i>James.</i> Surely, sir, you cannot mean it.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> But I do.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B.</i> Oh, sir, how can we ever sufficiently manifest
our gratitude for such unexpected generosity?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> By saying nothing about it. Remember, James
and wife, this is Christmas day, and on this day, of all
others, we should do unto others as we would have them

<p><i>Scro.</i> Don't say any thing, please. Come and see me.
Will you come and see me?</p>

<p><i>Mr. B.</i> I will&mdash;with great pleasure. [<i>Exit</i>, <span class='small'>R.</span>]</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Thank'er. I am much obliged to you. I thank
you fifty times. Bless you!</p>

<div class='center'><i>Enter Bob Cratchit</i>, <span class='small'>R.</span>, <i>with Tiny Tim on his shoulder</i>.</div>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Halloo, Bob Cratchit! What do you mean by
coming here?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> I am very sorry, sir; I was not coming, I was
only passing, sir, on my way to hear the Christmas carols.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> What right have you to be passing here to remind
me that it is Christmas?</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> It's only once a year, sir; it shall not be repeated.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Now, I'll tell you what, my friend. I am not going
to stand this any longer: and therefore I give you
permission to pass my house fifty times a day, if you
want to. I give you a week's vacation, without any deduction
for lost time. I am about to raise your salary.
(<i>Giving him a dig in the waistcoat; Bob staggers back,

my good fellow, than I have ever given you for many a
year! I'll raise your salary, and endeavor to assist your
struggling family, and I'll be Tiny Tim's Godfather.
Come along, my good fellow, we'll go to church together,
and discuss your affairs on the way. Tiny Tim, what do
you say to that?</p>

<p><i>Tiny Tim.</i> I say God bless us, every one.</p>

<p><i>Bob.</i> I would like to say something, sir, but you have
deprived me of the power of speech.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Come on, then, we'll talk it over as we go.
Come Tiny Tim, and go with your Godfather. (<i>Takes
Tim on his shoulder. Exeunt</i>, <span class='small'>L</span>.)<br /><br /></p>


<div class='hang1'>SCENE III.&mdash;<i>Drawing Room in Fred Merry's house.
Fred, Mrs. Fred and Mrs. Kemper discovered seated
at table, conversing.</i></div>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Is it possible! You surprise me. I never had
the least idea that you had ever met Uncle Scrooge, much
less that he was an old admirer of yours.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Oh! do tell us all about it, dear mother; I'm
dying to hear it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. K.</i> Well, you must know, my dear children, that
Fanny Scrooge&mdash;our mother, Fred&mdash;was my earliest friend
and schoolmate, and through her I became acquainted
with her brother&mdash;your uncle; at that time a noble spirited
boy, fresh from his studies. Our friendship soon ripened
into love, and a betrothal. I cannot describe to you how
happy and light hearted I was, and how true and devoted
your uncle continued. Our marriage was deferred until
such time as he should be in a position to provide us a
suitable home. After he left Mr. Fezziwig's, where he had
served his time, he entered the service of Jacob Marley,
and subsequently became his partner. It was at this time
I observed a change in him; he was not less ardent than
before, but I soon discovered that avarice had become
the guiding passion of his nature, and that our love
was subservient to its influence. Foreseeing that only
misery could ensue from our union, I released him from
the engagement. And now after the lapse of many years,
with the exception of the day, five years ago, when he
attended your father's funeral, we have not met or exchanged
a word with each other.</p>

<p><i>Mrs M.</i> But, mother, did you really love him?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mrs. K.</i> I did, my dear&mdash;previous to the discovery
of the change in him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> And did you not sacrifice your love in releasing
him?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. K.</i> I merely sacrificed my desires to common
sense. Love, to be lasting, must be mutual, and if it is
not paramount to all other passions, it ends in misery or
hate. Hence, being guided by judgment, I soon found
by experience that true love can again exist if worthily
bestowed.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Well, dear mother, I agree with your estimate
of Uncle Scrooge. This is the sixth Christmas Day of
our married life, and each Christmas Eve I have invited
him to come and dine with us, but he has never yet honored
us with his presence, and I suppose he never will.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> (<i>Gently opening the door and putting in his
head.</i>) Fred! may I come in? (<i>All start and rise, and
Fred rushes toward the door with both hands extended.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Why, bless my soul! who's that?</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> It's I, your Uncle Scrooge. I have accepted
your invitation. Will you let me in?</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Let you in! (<i>Shaking him heartily by both
hands.</i>) Dear heart alive! Why not! Welcome! welcome!
My wife, your niece&mdash;Yes, you may. (<i>Scrooge
kisses her.</i>) Our mother.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Belle! Heavens! What shall I do? (<i>Aside.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. K.</i> I fear that our meeting will be painful. I
beg your permission, my son, to retire.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> No, no, no. This is Christmas Day. Everybody
can be happy on this day that desires to be, and I know
that your meeting can be made a pleasant and agreeable
one if you both so will it. "Peace on earth and good
will to man," is the day's golden maxim.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Although somewhat embarrassed, I concur most
heartily in the wise and good-natured counsel of my dear
nephew. Never before have I experienced the joys common
to this day, and never hereafter, while I am permitted
to live, shall I miss them. In the past twenty-four hours
I have undergone a complete revolution of ideas and desires,
and have awakened unto a new life. Instead of a
sordid, avaricious old man, I trust you will find a cheerful,
liberal Christian, ever ready to extend to his fellow
creatures a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Why! uncle, I wonder <i>you</i> don't go into Parliament.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
I could dance for joy. (<i>Embracing him.</i>) You
dear old man! You shall ever find a hearty welcome
here.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I join with my husband in his earnest congratulations.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. K.</i> I confess, Mr. Scrooge, that I am rejoiced to
find your nephew's assertions so quickly verified, and that
an opportunity is offered to renew an acquaintance which
I hope will end in uninterrupted friendship. (<i>They shake
hands.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Ah, here comes Topper and the girls.</p>

<div class='center'><i>Enter Topper and Julia Kemper, Snapper and Sarah
Kemper.</i></div>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Come, girls, hug and kiss your Uncle Scrooge,
he has come to make merry with us. (<i>Takes the girls to
Scrooge, and endeavors to make them hug, doing most
of the hugging himself.</i>) Hug him hard! This is Topper,
and this is <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Suapper'">Snapper</ins>, they are both sweet on the girls.
(<i>All laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Julia and Sarah.</i> Oh, you bad man.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Come, let us lose no time. What do you say to
a game? Shall it be blind man's buff?</p>

<p><i>All.</i> Agreed.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Come, Uncle Scrooge, the oldest, first.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> Do with me as you please; it is Christmas
Day.</p>

<p>(<i>They play a lively game, falling over chairs, etc.
Scrooge catches each lady, and guesses wrong, until he
gets Mrs. Merry, who, in turn, catches Topper, who pulls
the bandage down and goes for Julia, and pretends that
he tells who she is by the way the hair is fixed, etc.
Scrooge and Mrs. Kemper retire up stage, and converse.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> Ah, that's not fair, you peeped. I won't play
any more. (<i>Goes up stage with Topper.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Well, I could have guessed that catch, and it's
nothing more than fair that he should peep before making
it. It seems, my dear, that our company have divided
into couples. Ought we not demand an explanation?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> As master of the house, it is your duty.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Mr. Thomas Topper and others, we have long
suspected you of some horrible design against the peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and happiness of this family. What say you to the
charge?</p>

<p><i>Julia.</i> On behalf our clients, we plead guilty.</p>

<p><i>Sarah.</i> And urge extenuating circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Fred.</i> Then nothing more remains, but for the Court
to pronounce sentence, which is, that you be placed under
the bonds of matrimony, at such time and place as may
suit your convenience. But, Madam Belle Kemper and
Ebenezer Scrooge, what have you to say in your defense.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. K.</i> Only this, that Christmas works wonders.</p>

<p><i>Scro.</i> In other words, Mrs. Kemper finds that Christmas
has restored me to a primitive condition, and leaves
it to time to test the merits of the happy change. (<i>To
audience.</i>) We all have cause to bless Christmas, and
it shall always be my delight to wish you A Merry Christmas,
and A Happy New Year, with Tiny Tim's addition
of "God bless us every one."</p>
